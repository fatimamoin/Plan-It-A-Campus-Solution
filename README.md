# Plan-It
Plan-It is a web based application that allows users to see all activities happening on campus at any hour, any day. It also allows them to see the activities each club/organization at campus is holding – agenda, location and time. The web app will also allow clubs to sign in and schedule their activities and sessions without any hassle. This application was developed as part of our Web and Mobile Developement Course and is based on the MVC.Net framework alongside JavaScript, HTML, and CSS3.
